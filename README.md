# Artificial-Intelligence-Based-Recommendation-System-for-Is-Bankasi-Menu-Suggestions

We adopted a machine-learning approach to provide the most relevant menu suggestions for mobile application users. 
In this process, we utilized the LightGBM classifier to train independent classification models for each menu. 
We then integrated the trained LightGBM model with OneVsRestClassifier to make it more suitable for multi-classification and trained this combined model on the training dataset.
